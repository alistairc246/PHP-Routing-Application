# PHP Web Emergency Response Application (Version 1.0)

This Application is a PHP Application which enables which consists of three different types of users (i.e. a FEMA Admin, Community Centers and a Truck Delivery Driver). Basically, the FEMA Admin would list the emergency items required. The individual community center users would then identify which items they can fulfill and finally the truck driver using the address of the community center would be routed to the center using google maps.
